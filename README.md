### 💬 About me ...

My background spans software engineering, finance, mathematics, and visual effects. The problems I enjoy solving at my day job concern technology operations challenges; I find resource allocation and operational effciency problems very engaging as they require finding the perfect balance of engineer autonomy, continuous improvement, shared vision, and effective change management. 

My interests in finance concern the valuation of projects with high volatility (ie. research and development, R&D, projects) where a naive cost/benefit analysis results in negative net present value. In simple terms, it is hard for a company to justify investment in highly uncertain/exploratory projects when applying conventional return-on-investment measures. See more in my [Lean Project Valuation repo and working paper](https://github.com/Alistair-Russell/Lean-Project-Valuation), or get in touch if this interests you! Bridging this gap in the world of technology is extremely motivating - the necessity of innovation is evident, yet it remains hard to quantify and justify.

### 🌱 Some current personal projects ...
* Development: A [lightweight issue tracking application](https://github.com/Alistair-Russell/spartan) using Go, HTMX, Turso
* Finance: A financial model and paper for [R&D Project Valuation using Option Pricing Theory](https://github.com/Alistair-Russell/Lean-Project-Valuation) with investor and entrepreneur interactions
