### üí¨ About me ...

My background spans software engineering, finance, mathematics, and visual effects. The problems I enjoy solving at my day job concern technology operations challenges; I find resource allocation and operational effciency problems very engaging as they require finding the perfect balance of engineer autonomy, continuous improvement, shared vision, and effective change management. 

My interests in finance concern the valuation of projects with high volatility (ie. research and development, R&D, projects) where a naive cost/benefit analysis results in negative net present value. In simple terms, it is hard for a company to justify investment in highly uncertain/exploratory projects when applying conventional return-on-investment measures. See more in my [Lean Project Valuation repo and working paper](https://github.com/Alistair-Russell/Lean-Project-Valuation), or get in touch if this interests you! Bridging this gap in the world of technology is extremely motivating - the necessity of innovation is evident, yet it remains hard to quantify and justify.

### üå± Some current personal projects ...
* Development: A lightweight issue tracking application using Go, HTMX, Turso
* Finance: A financial model and paper for R&D Project Valuation using Option Pricing Theory with investor and entrepreneur interactions

### üèÅ Completed projects ...

### üìö Reading list ...

Books I have found value in:

* The Phoenix Project (Kim, Behr, Spafford)
* The Lean Startup (Ries)
* Extreme Ownership (Willink, Babin)
* Range (David Epstein)
* The Great CEO Within (Mochary, MacCaw, Talavera)
* Staff Engineer (Larson)
* Accelerate (Forsgren, Humble, Kim)
* The Making of a Manager (Zhuo)

And a few that are just for the love of the game:

* [WIP] The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Tolkein) - Andy Serkis narrates these on audible and it's amazing... I hadn't attempted reading the books until now, it's been a blast.
* The Witcher Series (Sapkowski) - All of these are just so great.
* The Enderverse Series (Johnston, Scott Card)
