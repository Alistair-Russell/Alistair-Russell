### üí¨ About me ...

My background is in software engineering, finance, mathematics, and visual effects. The problems I most enjoy solving at my day job are technology operations challenges; I find these resource allocation problems very engaging as they require finding the perfect balance of engineering autonomy, continuous improvement, shared vision, and effective change management. 

My interests in the realm of finance are tangentially related - they concern the valuation of projects with extremely high volatility (ie. research and development, R&D, projects) where a naive cost/benefit analysis would result in a negative net present value. In simple terms, it's hard for a company to justify investment in highly uncertain/exploratory projects if they apply conventional return-on-investment measures. See more in my Lean Project Valuation repo / working paper, or get in touch if this interests you! Bridging this gap in the world of technology is extremely motivating because the necessity of innovation is evident, yet it remains hard to quantify and justify.

Books such as the The Phoenix Project, The Lean Startup, Accelerate, Range, and Extreme Ownership have been strong influences on my approach team improvement methodologies.

### üå± Some current personal projects ...
* Development: A lightweight issue tracking application using Go, HTMX, Turso
* Finance: A financial model and paper for R&D Project Valuation using Option Pricing Theory with investor and entrepreneur interactions

### üèÅ Completed projects ...

### üìö Reading list ...

Books I have found value in:

* The Phoenix Project (Kim, Behr, Spafford)
* The Lean Startup (Ries)
* Extreme Ownership (Willink, Babin)
* Range (David Epstein)
* The Great CEO Within (Mochary, MacCaw, Talavera)
* Staff Engineer (Larson)
* Accelerate (Forsgren, Humble, Kim)
* The Making of a Manager (Zhuo)

And a few that are just for the love of the game:

* [WIP] The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Tolkein) - Andy Serkis narrates these on audible and it's amazing... I hadn't attempted reading the books until now, it's been a blast.
* The Witcher Series (Sapkowski) - All of these are just so great.
* The Enderverse Series (Johnston, Scott Card)
